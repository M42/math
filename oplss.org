** Programming Languages Background 1
A programming language is defined by

 * *statics*, how it is written;
 * *dynamics*, how it is executed;

and they should be coherent in some way.

*** Statics
 1. Concrete syntax. Linear representations, usually. Psycology of
    programming languages determines how they are written.
 2. Abstract syntax.
 3. Context-sensitive conditions and well-formation.

The practical foundation are ABT (abstract binding trees); the syntax
is generated by operators with arguments.
