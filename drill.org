Definition of universal arrow

*** Definition
If $S \colon D \to C$ is a functor and $c \in C$, its *universal arrow* is
$(r,u)$ such that for every pair $(d,f)$ there exists this unique diagram

\[\begin{tikzcd}
 & Sd \\
c \rar[swap]{u}\urar{f} & Sr \uar[swap, dashed]{\exists! S \widetilde f}
\end{tikzcd}\]

*** Definition
An abelian category is a preadditive category (every morphisms set is
an abelian group and the composition is bilineal on it), satisfiying

 1. it has a *null object*.
 2. there is a *biproduct* of two numbers.
 3. every morphism has kernel and cokernel.
 4. every monic is a kernel.
 5. every epic is a cokernel.

*** Definition
A category satisfiying

 * every $hom(a,b)$ is an *abelian group*.
 * composition is *bilinear* with the group operation:
   $f(g+h) = fg+hg$ y $h(f+g) = hf+hg$.
