Definition of universal arrow

**** Definition
If $S \colon D \to C$ is a functor and $c \in C$, its *universal arrow* is
$(r,u)$ such that for every pair $(d,f)$ there exists this unique diagram

\[\begin{tikzcd}
 & Sd \\
c \rar[swap]{u}\urar{f} & Sr \uar[swap, dashed]{\exists! S \widetilde f}
\end{tikzcd}\]

Definition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category][abelian category]].

**** Definition
An abelian category is a preadditive category (every morphisms set is
an abelian group and the composition is bilineal on it), satisfiying

 1. it has a *null object*.
 2. there is a *biproduct* of two numbers.
 3. every morphism has kernel and cokernel.
 4. every monic is a kernel.
 5. every epic is a cokernel.

Definition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preadditive_category][preadditive category]]

**** Definition
A category satisfiying

 * every $hom(a,b)$ is an *abelian group*.
 * composition is *bilinear* with the group operation:
   $f(g+h) = fg+hg$ y $h(f+g) = hf+hg$.

** Finite order divides maximal order in abelian groups              :drill:

Let $g \in G$ *abelian* be an element of maximal /finite/ order: if $h \in G$ 
has finite order, $|h| \leq |g|$. Prove that if $h$ has finite order in $G$ 
then $|h|$ divides $|g|$.

*** Proof
If $|h|$ does not divide $|g|$, then there is a prime $p$ such that

 * $|h| = p^{a+b}m$
 * $|g| = p^bn$, with $\mathrm{gcd}(n,p) = 1$.

then we know that $|h^m| = p^{a+b}$ and $|g^{p^b}| = n$. Using that we are in a
commutative group, [[*Order of commutative products][we know]] that $|g^{p^b}h^m| = p^{a+b}n$, contradicting 
maximality.

If $g$ and $h$ commute, and $\mathrm{gcd}(|g|,|h|) = 1$, then $|gh| = |g||h|$.

*** Proof
We know $|gh| = N \mid |g||h|$, and

 * $1 = \left( g^{-1} \right)^{N|g|} = h^{N|g|}$
 * $1 = \left( h^{-1} \right)^{N|h|} = g^{N|h|}$

and then, $|h| \mid N|g|$ and they are coprimes, so $|h| \mid N$. Likewise, $|g| \mid N$.
Finally, $|g||h| = \mathrm{lcm}(|h|,|g|) \mid N$.

Given a quaternion $q$, how we define and compute $\mathrm{exp}(q)$?

*** Definition
We define the exponentiation using Taylor Series

\[\exp(q) =  1 + q + \frac{q^2}{2!} + \frac{q^3}{3!} + \dots + \frac{q^n}{n!} + \cdots\ .\]

*** Computation
If we write any quaternion as a versor, $q = \cos\theta + v\sin\theta$, we can
use that $v$ is unitary, $v^2 = -1$, to compute the Euler's formula for
quaternions

\[q = \exp(\theta v) = \cos \theta + v \sin \theta,\]

and then

\[q^t = \exp(t \theta v) = \cos (t \theta) + v \sin (t \theta).\]
