* 1. Categories, functors and natural transformations
** 1.3. Functors
*** Exercise 1
#+begin_statement
Show how each of the following constructions can be regarded as a functor:

 - the field of quotients of an integral domain.
 - the Lie algebra of a Lie group.
#+end_statement

**** Field of quotients
Given two integral domains and a ring homomorphism $f : R \to S$, we
define an homomorphism between its fields of quotients as:

\[
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)
=
\frac{f(a)}{f(b)}
\]

We can prove it is well-defined using that $ab=cd$ implies
$f(a)f(b) = f(c)f(d)$, and then:

\[
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)
=
\frac{f(a)}{f(b)}
=
\frac{f(c)}{f(d)}
=
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{c}{d}\right)
\]

And it respects sums and products:

\[
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}\right)
=
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{ad+cb}{bd}\right)
=
\frac{f(a)f(d)+f(c)f(d)}{f(b)f(d)}
=
\frac{f(a)}{f(b)}+\frac{f(c)}{f(d)}
\]

\[
\widetilde{f}\left(\frac{ac}{bd}\right) =
\frac{f(a)f(c)}{f(b)f(d)}
\]

So it is a field homomorphism.

**** TODO Lie algebra
Given $\phi : G \to H$, a Lie group homomorphism, we can compute its first
derivative at the identity $\phi^*$.
*** Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
Show that functors $1 \to C$, $2 \to C$, and $3 \to C$ correspond respectively to
objects, arrows, and composable pairs of arrows in $C$.
#+end_statement

A functor $F\colon 1 \to C$ is determined by $F1$. A functor $F\colon 2 \to C$ is determined
by $F(1\leq 2)\colon F1 \to F2$. A functor $F\colon 3 \to C$ is determined by $F(1\leq 2)$ and
$F(2\leq 3)$, which must be composable in $F2$.

*** Exercise 3
#+begin_statement
Interpret "functor" in the following special types of categories:

  1. A functor between two preorders is a function $T$ which is monotonic
     (i.e. $p \leq p'$ implies $Tp \leq Tp'$).
  2. A functor between two groups (one-object categories) is a morphism
     of groups.
  3. If $G$ is a group, a functor $G \to \mathtt{Set}$ is a permutation representation
     of $G$, while $G \to Matr_K$ is a matrix representation of $G$.
#+end_statement

**** First statement
A functor must be a monotonic function, as it has to send $(p\leq p')$ into
a morphism between $Tp$ and $Tp'$. This morphism exists if and only if 
$Tp \leq Tp'$.

**** Second statement
It respects the identity and the group operation, as functors respect
the identity and the composition.

**** Third statement
A functor $F\colon G \to \mathtt{Set}$ is determined by $FG$ and the assignment of every
element of $G$ to a set automorphism, that is, an element of the permutation
group of the set.

The functor $F\colon G \to \mathtt{Matr}_K$ selects a dimension $n$, and sends every element
of the group to an invertible matrix $M_{n\times n}$.

*** Exercise 4
#+begin_statement
Prove that there is no functor $\mathtt{Grp} \to \mathtt{Ab}$ sending each group $G$ to its
center. (Consider $S_2 \to S_3 \to S_2$, the symmetric groups).
#+end_statement

A functor must preserve identities and composition. We have the following
diagram in $\mathtt{Grp}$,

\[\begin{tikzcd}
S_2 \rar[hook]\arrow[rr,bend left, "id"] & S_3 \rar & S_2
\end{tikzcd}\]

that cannot be translated into $\mathtt{Ab}$ by this functor

\[\begin{tikzcd}
S_2 \rar & \{id\} \rar &  S_2
\end{tikzcd}\]

as we know that the identity is not the zero morphism.

*** Exercise 5
#+begin_statement
Find two different functors $T : \mathtt{Grp} \to \mathtt{Grp}$ with object function $T(G) = G$
the identity for every group $G$.
#+end_statement

The identity functor and a functor sending every morphism to the zero 
morphism.

** 1.4. Natural transformations
*** Exercise 1
#+begin_statement
Let $S$ be a fixed set, and $X^S$ the set of all functions $h : S \longrightarrow X$.
Show that $X \mapsto X^S$ is the object function of a functor $\mathtt{Set} \longrightarrow \mathtt{Set}$,
and that evaluation $e_X : X^S \times S \longrightarrow X$ defined by $e(h,s) = h(s)$, the
value of the function $h$ at $s \in S$ is a natural transformation.
#+end_statement

We define the functor $\_^S$ on arrows as follows. Given a $f : X \to Y$
and a $g : S \longrightarrow X$:

\[
f^S(g) = f \circ g
\]

And it follows the functor laws.

We can see that evaluation is a natural transformation with the
naturality square:

\[\begin{tikzcd}
X^S \times S \dar{e_X}\rar{f^S,id} & Y^S \times S \dar{e_Y}\\
X \rar{f} & Y
\end{tikzcd}\]

Which commutes on its elements:

\[\begin{tikzcd}
(f,s) \dar{e_X}\rar{g^S,id} & (g\circ f, s) \dar{e_Y}\\
f(s) \rar{f} & g(f(s))
\end{tikzcd}\]

*** Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
If $H$ is a fixed group, show that $G \mapsto H \times G$ defines a functor
$H \times - \colon \mathtt{Grp}\to \mathtt{Grp}$ and that each morphism $f \colon H \to K$ of groups defines
a natural transformation $H \times -\; \dot\to \; K \times -$.
#+end_statement

The functor will send a morphism $f \colon G \to G'$ to $\mathrm{id}\times f\colon H\times G \to H \times G'$.
The naturality condition is satisfied if the following diagram commutes

\[\begin{tikzcd}
H \times G \dar{\mathrm{id}\times f} \rar{g\times\mathrm{id}} & 
K \times G \dar{\mathrm{id}\times f} \\
H \times G' \rar{g\times\mathrm{id}} & 
K \times G'
\end{tikzcd}\]

but it is trivial to check commutativity.

*** Exercise 3
#+begin_statement
If $B$ and $C$ are groups (regarded as categories with one object each) and
$S,T \colon B \to C$ are functors (homomorphisms of groups), show that there is a
natural transformation $S \dot\to T$ if and only if $S$ and $T$ are conjugate; i.e.
if and only if there is an element $h \in C$ with $Tg = h(Sg)h^{-1}$ for all
$g \in B$.
#+end_statement

If the only object in $B$ is $b$, then $Sb = Tb = c$ must be the only object
in $c$. Naturality gives us

\[\begin{tikzcd}
c\rar{\varphi} \dar[swap]{Sf} & c \dar{Tf} \\
c\rar{\varphi} & c
\end{tikzcd}\]

so we know that $Sf \circ \varphi = \varphi \circ Tf$, and this is the conjugate condition.

*** Exercise 4
#+begin_statement
For functors $S,T \colon C \to P$ where $C$ is a category and $P$ a preorder, show
that there is a natural transformation $S \dot\to T$ (which is then unique) if
and only if $Sc \leq Tc$ for every object $c \in C$.
#+end_statement

To define a natural transformation, we must have a familiy of morphisms

\[
Sc \to Tc \quad\forall c \in C,
\]

but this morphism exists if and only if $Sc \leq Tc$ for every object. If the
morphisms exist, the naturality condition is trivial, as there will be
an unique morphism between two objects and all squares will commute.

*** Exercise 5
#+begin_statement
Show that every natural transformation $\tau\colon S \dot\to T$ defines a function
(also called $\tau$) which sends each arrow $f\colon c \to c'$ of $C$ to an arrow
$\tau f\colon Sc \to Tc'$ of $B$ in such a way that $Tg \circ \tau f = \tau(gf) = \tau g\circ Sf$ for
each composable pair $(g,f)$. Conversely, show that every such function $\tau$ 
comes from a unique natural transformation with $\tau_c = \tau(1_c)$. (This gives 
an arrows only description of a natural transformation.)
#+end_statement

Given $f\colon c \to c'$, we apply the naturality condition and take $\tau$ to be the
diagonal

\[\begin{tikzcd}
Sc \drar{\tau f} \rar{\tau} \dar[swap]{Sf} & Tc \dar{Tf} \\
Sc'\rar{\tau} & Tc'
\end{tikzcd}\]

i.e. we have defined $\tau f = Tf\circ \tau_c = \tau_{c'} \circ Sf$. The condition holds now 
trivially, as we know that

\[
Tg \circ \tau f = Tg\circ Tf\circ \tau_c = \tau(gf) = \tau_{c'}\circ Sg\circ Sf
= \tau g \circ Sf.
\]

*** TODO Exercise 6
#+begin_statement
Let $F$ be a field. Show that te category of all finite-dimensional vector
spaces over $F$ (with morphisms all lineal transformations) is equivalent
to the category $\mathtt{Matr}$.
#+end_statement
** 1.5. Monics, epis and zeros
*** Exercise 1
#+begin_statement
Find a category with an arrow which is both epi and monic, but not 
invertible (e.g., dense subset of a topological space).
#+end_statement

In the $\mathtt{Top}$ category of topological spaces with continuous functions,
we can include a dense subset in its base space. This inclusion will
be a monomorphism (as it is injective) and an epimorphism as we know
that, if $i \colon U \subset V$ is our inclusion,

\[ f\circ i = i \circ g \implies f|_{U} = g|_{U},\]

and because it is a dense subset, by continuity, $f = g$.

But it has not to be an isomorphism. In fact, it won't be if $U$ is a
proper subset.

*** Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
Prove that the composite of monics is monic, and likewise for epis.
#+end_statement

If $f,g$ are monics, we can apply the definition twice to get

\[
f \circ g \circ a = f \circ g \circ b \implies
g \circ a = g\circ b \implies
a = b.
\]

The same proof can be applied in reverse.

*** Exercise 3
#+begin_statement
If a composite $g\circ f$ is monic, so is $f$. Is this true of $g$?
#+end_statement

No, $f$ could be a zero morphism and $g$ could still give $g\circ h = g\circ h'$ for
two $h \neq h'$.

*** Exercise 4
#+begin_statement
Show that the inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is epi in the category $\mathtt{Rng}$.
#+end_statement

If $f \circ i = g \circ i$, then $f|_{\mathbb{Z}} = g|_{\mathbb{Z}$, and we can extend the morphisms uniquely
to the ring $\mathbb{Q}$, as the ring morphisms have to preserve inverses.

*** TODO Exercise 5
#+begin_statement
In $\mathtt{Grp}$ prove that every epi is surjective (Hint. If $\varphi\colon G\to H$ has image
$M$ not $H$, use the factor group $H/M$ if $M$ has index 2. Otherwise, let
$\mathrm{Perm}\ H$ be the group of all permutations of the set $H$, choose three
different cosets $M,Mu$ and $Mv$ of $M$, define $\sigma \in \mathrm{Perm}\ H$ by
$\sigma(xu) = xv$, $\sigma(xv) = xu$ for $x \in M$, and $\sigma$ otherwise the identity.
Let $\psi\colon H \to \mathrm{Perm}\ H$ send each $h$ to left multiplication $\psi_h$ by $h$, while
$\psi'_h = \sigma^{-1}\psi_h\sigma$. Then $\psi\varphi = \psi'\varphi$, but $\psi \neq \psi'$).
#+end_statement

*** Exercise 6
#+begin_statement
In $\mathtt{Set}$, show that all idempotents split.
#+end_statement

Given $f \colon A \to A$ idempotent, we can define the set $\mathrm{img}\ f$, and two functions
$g \colon A \to \mathrm{img}\ f$, $h\colon \mathrm{img}\ f \to A$ defined naturally and satisfiying the conditions.
Notice that $g$ is an epimorphism and $h$ a monomorphism.

*** Exercise 7
#+begin_statement
An arrow $f \colon a \to b$ in a category $C$ is /regular/ when there exists an arrow
$g\colon b \to a$ such that $fgf = f$. Show that $f$ is regular if it has either a left or
a right inverse, and prove that every arrow in $\mathtt{Set}$ with $a \neq \varnothing$ is regular.
#+end_statement

If $f$ has either a right or a left inverse, it is trivial that it is regular.

If $a \neq \varnothing$, we can take $x_y \in \left\{ x \in a \mid f(x) = y \right\}$, a representative of the class
of elements that are mapped onto $y$, and $u \in a$ an arbitrary element, and define

\[
g(y) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
x_y & \mbox{if } y \in \mathrm{img}(f)  \\
u & \mbox{otherwise }
\end{array} 
\right.
\]

and this morphism makes the $f$ regular. (Have we used the choice axiom to define
the representatives?)

*** Exercise 8
#+begin_statement
Consider the category with objects $\left\langle X,e,t \right\rangle$, where $X$ is a set, $e \in X$, and
$t \colon X \to X$, and with arrows $f\colon \left\langle X,e,t \right\rangle \to \left\langle X',e',t' \right\rangle$ the functions $f$ on $X$ to $X'$
with $fe=e'$ and $ft = tf'$. Prove that this category has an initial object in
which $X$ is the set of natural numbers, $e=0$, and $t$ is the successor function.
#+end_statement

We will prove that $\left\langle \mathbb{N},0,S \right\rangle$ is the initial object. For every object $\left\langle X,e,t \right\rangle$,
we only can define a function $f$, its image on zero is determined by the
first arrow condition $f(0) = e$, and its image in every other natural is
determined as

\[
f(n) = f(S \circ \overset{n}\dots \circ S(0)) = t\circ \overset{n}\dots \circ t(f(0)).
\]

*** Exercise 9
#+begin_statement
If the functor $T \colon C \to B$ is faithful and $Tf$ is monic, prove $f$ monic.
#+end_statement

If $f\circ g = f \circ h$, we have $Tf\circ Tg = Tf\circ Th$. $Tf$ is monic and $T$ is faithful, so
we get $g = h$.

** TODO 1.6. Foundations

** 2.3. Products of categories

#+begin_statement
Show that the product of categories includes the following known special
cases: The product of monoids (categories with one object), of groups,
of sets (discrete categories).
#+end_statement

*** TODO Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
Show that the product of two preorders is a preorder.
#+end_statement

*** TODO Exercise 4
#+begin_statement
Describe the opposite of the category $\mathtt{Matr}_K$.
#+end_statement

*** Exercise 5
#+begin_statement
Show that the ring of continuous real-valued functions on a topological
space is the object function of a contravariant functor on $\mathtt{Top}$ to $\mathtt{Rng}$.
#+end_statement

We are going to define the functor $T \colon \mathtt{Top}\to \mathtt{Rng}$ taking $Tf$ to be
$(\circ f) \colon \mathrm{hom}_{\mathtt{Top}}(Y,\mathbb{R}) \to \mathrm{hom}_{\mathtt{Top}}(X,\mathbb{R})$ for any given $f \colon X \to Y$. It is 
trivially a functor, as it preserves composition.

We know that the composition of two continuous functions is
continuous, and we have to prove that $(\circ f)$ is a ring homomorphism,
but it is trivial that

\[\begin{aligned}
(g\cdot h) \circ f &= (g \circ f) \cdot (h \circ f) \\
(g + h) \circ f &= (g \circ f) + (h \circ f). \\
\end{aligned}
\]

** TODO 2.4. Functor categories
** TODO 2.5. The category of all categories
** 2.6. Comma categories
*** Exercise 1
#+begin_statement
If $K$ is a commutative ring, show that the comma category $(K \downarrow \mathtt{CRng})$ is
the usual category of all small commutative $K\text{-algebras}$.
#+end_statement

A $K\text{-algebra}$ can be defined as an inclusion from $K$ on a ring, morphisms
of algebras must preserve this inclusion.

# A more detailed proof would be interesting.

*** Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
If $t$ is a terminal object in $C$, prove that $(C \downarrow t)$ is isomorphic to $C$.
#+end_statement

By definition of terminal object, there will be only an arrow 
$\ast \colon u \to t$ for any $u \in C$. Every morphism will create a commutative 
diagram because of the unicity of the morphisms.

* 3. Universals and limits
** 3.1. Universal arrows
*** Exercise 1
#+begin_statement
Show how each of the following familiar constructions can be interpreted
as a universal arrow:

 * The integral group ring of a group (better, of a monoid).
 * The tensor algebra of a vector space.
 * The exterior algebra of a vector space.
#+end_statement

**** The integral group ring (monoid)
The integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ is defined as the initial object of $(G \downarrow {\cal U})$,
where ${\cal U}$ is the functor that takes a ring and returns its group of units.

**** The tensor algebra of a vector space
The tensor algebra $T(V)$ is defined as the initial object of $(V \downarrow U)$,
where $U\colon \mathtt{Alg}_k \to \mathtt{Vect}_k$ is the forgetful functor.

**** The exterior algebra of a vector space
The same construction as above can be performed on the full subcategory of
external algebras.

*** Exercise 2
#+begin_statement
Find a universal element for the contravariant power set functor
${\cal P} \colon \mathtt{Set}^{op} \to \mathtt{Set}$.
#+end_statement

The universal arrow for $A$ will be its inclusion in ${\cal P}{\cal P}A$ as

\[
i(a) = \left\{ U \in {\cal P}A \mid a \in U \right\}.
\]

Given a morphism $f \colon A \to {\cal P}B$, we define $g \colon B \to {\cal P}A$ as

\[
g(b) = \left\{ a \in A \mid b \in f(a) \right\}.
\]

And its image when the functor is applied is

\[
{\cal P}g(\mathbb{A}) = g^{-1}(\mathbb{A})
= \left\big\{ b \in B \mid \left\{ a \mid b \in f(a) \right\} \in \mathbb{A} \right\big\}.
\]

The $g$ is unique, as it is defined by $x \in f(a) \iff a \in g(x)$.

*** Exercise 3
#+begin_statement
Find (from any given object) universal arrows to the following forgetful
functors: $\mathtt{Ab} \to \mathtt{Grp}$, $\mathtt{Rng}\to \mathtt{Ab}$ (forget the multiplication), $\mathtt{Top} \to \mathtt{Set}$,
$\mathtt{Set}_{\ast} \to \mathtt{Set}$.
#+end_statement

**** Abelian groups to groups
The universal arrow defines the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_subgroup][abelianization]] of the group. A morphism
from a group to an abelian group must have the commutator subgroup in 
its kernel

\[f(aba^{-1}b^{-1}) = f(a)f(b)f(b)^{-1}f(a)^{-1} = 1.\]

Thus, every morphism can be factorized in $G/[G,G]$, giving

\[\begin{tikzcd}
g \rar[hook]{i}\drar[swap]{f} & G/[G,G]\dar[dashed]{\widetilde f} \\
  & h & .
\end{tikzcd}\]

**** WIP Rings to abelian groups
A tensor Z-algebra over the abelian group.

**** Topological spaces to sets
The inclusion on the discrete topology over the set is an universal
arrow. If we define any application $f\colon A \to O$, there is an unique 
continuous function $\widetilde f \colon (A,\tau_d) \to (O,\tau)$ defined by $\widetilde f(x) = f(x)$. It is
trivially continuous, as $\tau_d$ is the discrete topology.

**** Pointed sets to sets
Trivially, the inclusion on $(S \cup \left\{ \ast \right\}, \ast)$ defines an universal arrow.

*** TODO Exercise 4
#+begin_statement
Use only universality (of projections) to prove the following isomorphisms of
group theory:

 1) For normal subgroups $M,N$ of $G$ with $M \subset N$, $(G/M)(N/M) \cong (G/M)$.
 2) For subgroups $S$ and $N$ of $G$, $N$ normal, with join $SN$, $SN/N \cong S/S\cap N$.
